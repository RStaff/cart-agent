<h3>No Celebrity Endorsements; Style-Only Tones; No Impersonation</h3>
<p>Abando’s “tone/persona” settings are <strong>generic style descriptors only</strong>. They do not use or claim any celebrity’s
name, image, voice, or likeness, and they do not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation. The Service is designed
to avoid impersonation and to produce brand-safe, generic messaging.</p>
<p><strong>You agree not to configure or deploy outputs that:</strong> (a) state or suggest that any public figure or brand endorses or
is affiliated with you or your products; (b) use a person’s name, image, voice, or likeness in a manner that violates
applicable <em>right of publicity</em> laws; or (c) create a likelihood of consumer confusion as to endorsement, sponsorship,
or affiliation, including under the <em>U.S. Lanham Act § 43(a)</em> (15 U.S.C. §1125(a)).</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, references to styles like “high-energy comedian” or “empowering pop icon” are provided as
non-attributive stylistic prompts. Abando does not permit, and you will not enable, outputs that name, impersonate, or
otherwise exploit a specific individual’s identity without permission.</p>
<!-- END:NO_CELEB_SECTION -->

<h3>Persona &amp; Likeness</h3>
<p>The Service may offer “persona” styles for tone (e.g., “high-energy”, “confident”, “friendly”) to help generate copy. These styles are generic and do not imply endorsement, sponsorship, affiliation, or involvement by any public figure or third party. Customer will not use outputs to impersonate any person or to mislead recipients into believing that a public figure endorses Customer’s products or services.</p>
<h3>User Representations &amp; Liability</h3>
<p>Customer is responsible for its use of generated content and will ensure compliance with applicable laws (including marketing, advertising, and right-of-publicity laws). Customer will not use the Service to violate rights of publicity or to create deceptive or infringing content.</p>
