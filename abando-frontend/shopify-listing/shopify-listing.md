## 3. Long description

### Overview

Abando is an AI-powered cart recovery app built for merchants who care about both **revenue** and **respecting their customers**.  
Instead of blasting generic reminders, Abando analyzes behavior to segment shoppers by **urgency**, **risk**, and **lifetime value**, then triggers recovery flows tailored to each segment.

You get clearer insight into **who is at risk**, **how valuable they are**, and **which offers work best** – without turning your brand into spam.

---

### How it works

1. **Connect your store**  
   Install Abando from the Shopify App Store and connect your Shopify store in a few clicks.

2. **Abando watches checkout behavior**  
   Abando listens for abandoned cart events and streams them into our secure AI engine.

3. **AI segments each shopper**  
   Every event is labeled with a segment (for example: `vip`, `high_value_elevated`, `low_value_normal`) and attributes like urgency and churn risk.

4. **Trigger recovery flows that fit each segment**  
   Use those segments to power your email, SMS, or on-site prompts—so high-value, high-risk carts get more attention than casual browsers.

5. **Measure uplift with our playground dashboard**  
   The built-in “Demo Playground” and live dashboards show you segment performance, recovered revenue, and churn-risk patterns over time.

### Why merchants choose Abando

- **Ethical by design**  
  Abando is built on a **transparent, privacy-first** philosophy. No dark patterns, no surprise data usage. You keep control of your customer relationships.

- **Segmentation you can explain to your CFO**  
  Instead of opaque “AI magic,” Abando shows you the segments, scores, and recovery logic in plain language. You can walk your team through exactly what’s happening.

- **Fast to install, safe to test**  
  A dedicated **Embedded App Shell** and **Admin Entry page** keep the integration clean: merchants install from Shopify, manage Abando from their admin, and can safely explore our demo data before committing.

## 4. Core features (for “Key features” section)

1. **AI cart segmentation engine**  
   Classifies abandoned carts into segments like `vip`, `high_value_elevated`, and `low_value_normal`, each with urgency and risk labels.

2. **Live “AI Segments – Demo Playground” dashboard**  
   Shows real-time events, segment performance, and recent abandoned carts, so teams can *see* Abando working, not just trust a number.

3. **Clean Shopify-native admin entry**  
   Merchants access Abando directly from **Apps → Abando** inside Shopify, via an embedded app shell designed specifically for Shopify Admin.

4. **Privacy-first, transparent data usage**  
   Clear Terms, Privacy, and DPA are available right from the app footer and listing – making it easier to get buy-in from legal and leadership.

5. **Ready for future automation**  
   Segments and risk scores are designed to plug into your existing email/SMS tools, so you can build automated flows around the Abando labels.

## 5. Target merchant profile (internal)

- Shopify brands doing **$20k+/month** in revenue.
- Stores with **email/SMS marketing already in place** but low recovery rates.
- Teams that value **ethics, transparency, and long-term LTV**, not just short-term blasts.

---

## 6. Example use cases

- **VIP Saver Flow**  
  When a VIP customer abandons a high-value cart with high churn risk, trigger a personalized email and limited-time incentive.

- **Price-sensitive segment**  
  For `low_value_normal` segments, send fewer reminders and softer offers to avoid over-discounting.

- **Churn-risk intelligence for CX**  
  Use Abando’s churn-risk labels to prioritize which abandoned carts your support or sales teams should follow up on manually.
